# EmergingTechTaskProject


## Intro
This Project is for 4th Year Software Development Semester 1's module "Emerging Technology".<br/>
The goal of this project is to use the Jupyter Notebook to do various tasks of different topics. It is to increase our own ability to self learn and expand our knowledge in both Python and other functioning libraries.<br/>
It is wrote in the Python programming language Version 3.<br/>
The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization and machine learning.<br/>

## Tasks
### Task 1
This Task involves finding the square route of the number 2, and printing it to 100 decimal places.  The code however cannot depend on any module from the standard library or otherwise. One of the methods we can use to do this is Newtons method. We could us this to print out the square root of 2 very simply. However, as this is coded in python, its print method will only print a float value up to 52 places after the decimal point.
To work against this we use a googol. A googol is essentially 10 to the power of 100. 

### Task 2
Task 2 involves using the Chi-Square test to varify the chi-squared value. We do this by using pre-defined data given to us.

The Chi-squared test is a statistical hypothesis test determines whether there is an association between catagorical variables. This basically means it can find out if variables are independant or related to one another.

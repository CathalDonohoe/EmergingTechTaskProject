    "One method of doing this task is with newtons method. This is the commented out sqrt function, but this will only print the float to a few places, not to 100. Therefore, i designed the dqrt2 function below.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly i declare the number 2 to be a variable. I then get the square root of this number by mulitplying it by the power of 1/2(0.5). I then quickly print it out to show that it worked correctly. I then create a googol. A googol is the large number 10 ** 100. I then mulitply the square root by a googol ** 2, this will move the value of squareroot to the left side of the decimal place to 100 places.  \n",
    "Then i use a  while loop of when an empty variable(placeholder) is not equal to googol. The placeholder is then set to the value of the google. We then use floor divison, Floor division means after performing the division, results in the lower integer to the value.\n",
    "When the while loop is done i cast the googol as a string to another variable. I then search that string  for the first instance of a '4'. This integer is the first number after the decimal place in the square root of 2, so before this integer, I insert a dceimal place '.'. I then print out the edited string.\n",
